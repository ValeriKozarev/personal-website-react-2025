# Welcome to my personal website README!
Every few years  I rebuild my personal website to explore new tools, stay current with industry trends, and sharpen my skills. You'll find career highlights, personal projects, and little snapshots into some of my hobbies throughout - feel free to explore and get in touch. I built this site with React 19, Vite 7, and Tailwind CSS 4.
